Understanding hypervisors
=========================

A hypervisor is an OS that runs on a physical server and pools the
available physical resources into the virtual resources that VMs require.
You use a hypervisor to run and manage your VMs. This document refers
to VMware ESXiâ„¢, which is a type of hypervisor. The word hypervisor can
also refer to the physical machine on which ESXi is installed.
