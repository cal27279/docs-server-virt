Understanding migrations using vmotion
======================================

There are two forms of VM migration to consider when working with
Server Virtualization. The first form of migration is an initial
migration that occurs when you become a Rackspace Technology customer
and migrate an existing workload to Server Virtualization.
See :ref:`migrate-a-workload-to-vmware-server-virtualization` for
more information about migrating a workload from another environment
to Server Virtualization.

**Note:** Donâ€™t use vMotion to migrate external workloads to
Server Virtualization or migrate a VM from RPC-V to Server Virtualization.

The other form of migration refers to the methods by which VMs are migrated
from one host or datastore to another host or datastore within the
VMware Server Virtualization environment. This form of migration happens
either on a daily basis, often without your awareness as a result of
automated action, or because you requested it.

The following forms of migration are available depending on what you
need to move:

* **vMotion:** vMotion is the technology that we use to migrate a VM from
one ESXi host to another ESXi host. Depending on the circumstances,
the migration can occur either offline or online. DRS uses vMotion
automatically to balance the load between ESXi hosts.

* **Storage vMotion:** Storage vMotion migrates a VM from one VMFS
datastore to another. The target datastore must have sufficient space.
Storage vMotion migration can take a long time to complete, so your
system might experience performance degradation during the
migration operation.

* **vMotion without Shared Storage:** vMotion without Shared Storage
combines vMotion and storage vMotion. vMotion without Shared Storage is
most commonly used for migration between two standalone hypervisors.
