Appendix 1: Licensing
=====================

Licensing is handled in several ways for VMware Server Virtualization.

**VMware licensing:** VMware vSphere licensing is leased through Rackspace
Technology and installed during provisioning.

**Windows licensing:** Customers can provide their own Windows OS and SQL
licensing or lease Rackspace Technology-provided Windows licenses.
If you lease Windows licensing from Rackspace Technology,
we activate the license.

**Red Hat licensing:** Customers can provide their own OS licenses
or lease a Rackspace Technology-provided Red Hat Enterprise Linux
(RHEL) OS license. If you lease OS licensing from
Rackspace Technology, we can activate it with the Rackspace Technology
Red Hat Network (RHN) server.

**Database licensing:** Customers can provide their own database
licenses or lease Rackspace Technology-provided database licensing.
