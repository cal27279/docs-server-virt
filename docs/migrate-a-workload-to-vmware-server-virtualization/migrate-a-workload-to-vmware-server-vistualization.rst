Migrate a workload to VMware Server virtualization
==================================================

When you become a Rackspace Technology customer, you might already
have VMs operating in other environments that you want to migrate to
Rackspace VMware Server Virtualization. Rackspace Technology offers
the following options to assist with that migration.

* **Customer Managed Migration:** We can provision new VMs for you to
  perform manual data migration.

You can send physical media to us to import existing OVA/OVF file(s)
into your VMware Server Virtualization environment. Unless you reconfigure
the VMs to meet Rackspace Technology managed support standards,
these imports are considered Managed VMs with an Unsupported OS.
For more information about the reconfiguration process,
consult your account team.

* **Professional Services Migration:** You can work with our Professional
  Services team to design, plan, and migrate existing workloads into
  VMware Server Virtualization environments. Refer to `Professional Services
  <https://www.rackspace.com/professional-services/migrations/>`_
  for more information on Professional Services engagements.
