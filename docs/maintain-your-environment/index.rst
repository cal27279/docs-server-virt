Maintain your environment
=========================



To reduce the risk of certain change requests, Rackspace Technology or
customers can recommend that certain functions occur in a scheduled
maintenance. These scheduled maintenances ensure that the following 
are available to the customer:

* Reserved Rackspace Technology resources to complete the defined
* tasks of the maintenance.
* Documented maintenance preparation and quality checks from all
  departments involved in the maintenance.
* Defined length of maintenance to accomplish the defined tasks.
* Documented rollback plan in the event of unforeseen circumstances
  during execution.

Because we cannot confirm the full scope of a maintenance until we
completeall quality checks, Rackspace Technology schedules only after all
quality checks have passed.

Because we base the maintenance calendar scheduling on availability
of all teams involved, we accept reservations on a first-come,
first-served basis. However, if this maintenance is urgent or if
there is a limited timeline in which to execute it, contact your
account team to see if we can accommodate your need.

ESXi patching
_____________



Subject to technical eligibility, or if you are running or at risk of
running an unsupported ESXi version, we might proactively upgrade your
hypervisor to a newer ESXi version. If we plan to proactively upgrade
you, we notify you in accordance with the
Dedicated Hosting Terms and Conditions.

We also work with you to perform VMware ESXi upgrades at your request
or to address critical vulnerabilities.

Because your VMware Server Virtualization configuration can vary,
we recommend reaching out to your account team to discuss upgrade 
options that best suit your environment and needs.

OS patching

Rackspace Technology provides a managed OS patching service for supported
operating systems and tests all patches in lab-environments before
applying monthly to customer environments. Rackspace Technology and
the customer agree on the patching schedule.

The monthly testing schedule refers only to Guest OS.
