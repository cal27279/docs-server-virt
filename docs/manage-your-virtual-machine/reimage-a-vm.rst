============
Reimage a VM
============

Reimage a VM when you want to reinstall and reconfigure the VM.
For example, you might want to reimage your VM when you have completed
application testing or you want to repurpose the VM.

Reimaging removes the VM, including all data you have stored on it,
all applications, the OS, and any configurations. In its place,
a fresh VM deploys.

**Note:** Reimaging a VM is permanent and irreversible. If you need data
on your VM, ensure that you save it elsewhere. The VM is unavailable
for several hours while it is reimaged.

1. Log in to the Rackspace Technology Customer Portal and click
   **Products > VMware Server Virtualization**.
2. On the list of virtual machines, select the virtual machine
   you want to reimage.
   This action opens the virtual machine's details.
3. Click **Actions > Re-image VM**.
4. Enter any special instructions to include in the support ticket.

5. Click **Request Re-Image**.
This action creates a ticket that you can use to track your request.

**Note**: You can also click the cog icon ( ) next to the VM on the
**Virtual Machine list** to access the **Actions** drop-down menu.
