Power a VM on and off
=====================

Power off a VM when you don’t need it and don’t want to delete it.
Powering off a VM from within the Rackspace Technology Customer Portal
suspends billing and alerting for that VM. You can power the VM back on
at any time. After you power on a VM, billing and alerting resumes.

**Note:** Powering on a VM might require review from a
Rackspace VMware Support technician. For best practice and security reasons,
OS updates might need to be applied before the VM is returned to service,
depending upon the length of time the VM has been powered off. This request
generates a ticket, and the Rackspace VMware Support team updates
the ticket accordingly.

**Note:** Do not power off your VM from within the OS. Billing and alerts
are not suspended when you use the OS to power off the VM.

1. Log in to the Rackspace Technology Customer Portal and click
   **Products > VMware Server Virtualization**.
2. On the list of virtual machines, select the virtual machine
   that you want to power on or off.
   This action opens the VM’s details.
3.	Click **Actions > Power VM**.
4.	Click **Power Off Virtual Machine** or **Power On Virtual Machine**.

**Note:** You can also click the *cog* icon next to the VM on the
**Virtual Machine** list to access the **Actions** drop-down menu.
